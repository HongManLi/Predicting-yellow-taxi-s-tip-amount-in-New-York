# Predicting-yellow-taxi-s-tip-amount-in-New-York

This project utilizes data obtained from this website https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page.
It uses yellow taxi data from the second week of 2016 to generate a model, and then uses this model to predict taxi tip amount for the fourth week of 2016. The datasets are moderately large with over 2 million entries.

This project involves comprehensive data cleaning and data exploration with ggplot. Additionally, advanced features such as cross validation methods in determining AIC lambdas and in determining an optimal number of variables have been used.
